👋 Hi, I'm Hristo Hristov!
I'm a DevOps/Unix Engineer from Dupnitsa, Bulgaria, with a passion for turning complexity into seamless automation. With a strong foundation in cloud operations, performance monitoring, and scripting, I enjoy solving intricate problems with a hint of dark humor and a lot of technical know-how.

🚀 About Me
Think of me as the IT enthusiast who makes automation look effortless—though not without a bit of squinting at the screen! My technical expertise spans cloud operations, infrastructure management, and DevOps practices. Despite occasionally mistaking C# for "Can't See #$%&," I thrive on scripting, automation, and performance optimization.

I believe in blending technical prowess with humor, and if you're looking for someone who can navigate the tech maze with both sarcasm and skill, then let's connect!
